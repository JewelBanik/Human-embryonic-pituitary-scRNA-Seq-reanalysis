Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 4113 individual cells from human fetal pituitaries reveals divergent developmental trajectories with distinct transitional intermediate states in five hormone-producing cell lineages. These results provide insights into the transcriptional landscape of human pituitary development, defining distinct cell substates and subtypes and illustrating transcription factor dynamics during cell fate commitment.

Here, I reanalyzed the publicly available raw dataset to investigate Musashi, an RNA binding protein and cell fate determinant, expression in the human embryonic pituitary cells at different time point. 

Our analysis revealed that MSI1 is surprisingly highly expressed than MSI2 in the human embryonic pituitary; however, the expression pattern changes as the cells mature and MSI2 expression dominates over MSI1 in adult pituitary cells.
